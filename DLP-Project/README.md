This project involves implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) within Microsoft Purview to protect an organization’s sensitive information. The process begins with identifying and defining the types of sensitive data to safeguard, such as personally identifiable information, financial records, health data, and intellectual property. Clear goals and strategies are established to align DLP efforts with compliance requirements and organizational risk tolerance. The project then moves to configuring detailed DLP policies in Purview—selecting where policies apply, setting detection rules, defining actions like blocking or notifying users, and conducting phased testing before enforcement. Continuous monitoring and refinement ensure effective protection while minimizing disruptions. This implementation strengthens data security, supports regulatory compliance, and promotes responsible data handling across the organization.
