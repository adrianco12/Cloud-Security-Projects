# Cloud-Security-Projects
A collection of hands-on cloud security projects using Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Purview, and Microsoft 365 E5 to improve identity protection, data loss prevention, and threat response.

This repo includes the following projects:
1. Conditional Access Policy Creation - 
  Objective: Implement policies based on regularly reviewing sign-in logs, monitoring audit logs, analyzing risky users through machine learning (ML) in Microsoft Identity Protection, researching best practices, and complying with industry standards and benchmarks.
3. Privileged Identity Management Implementation - 
  Objective: Research PIM features in Azure and identify accounts that should be configured with it. Implement PIM by enforcing just-in-time (JIT) access and approval workflows. 
4. DLP in Purview - 
  Objective: Scan and classify sensitive data in Microsoft Purview to detect PII and reduce data exposure risks.

Technologies Used:
- Azure AD / Entra ID
- Microsoft Purview
- Microsoft 365

These projects demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and document enterprise-grade security controls in Microsoft Azure. They reflect my knowledge of identity governance, cloud access security, and data protection. These skills are essential for roles in cloud security or IT administration.
